# Changelog

All notable changes to SSHSpan are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.6] - 2026-09-01

### Fixed

- Linux CI: the release upload step failed with "Pattern 'release/*.AppImage
  release/*.deb' does not match any files" — space-separated globs are read as
  a single literal pattern. Artifact globs are one per line again, with an
  explicit job `name` so the Actions UI stays readable.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-09-01

### Fixed

- Linux CI: electron-builder rejected the deb build with "Please specify
  author 'email' in the application package.json" (required by deb package
  metadata). Added `author.email` to package.json.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-09-01

### Fixed

- Linux CI: `tests/smoke-app.js` hardcoded the Windows ssh-keygen path
  (`C:\Windows\System32\OpenSSH\ssh-keygen.exe`), so the app suite failed on
  the Linux runner. The test now resolves ssh-keygen per platform.
- Release workflow: single-line matrix `artifacts` values (multiline values
  produced garbled job names and unreadable logs).

## [1.0.3] - 2026-09-01

### Fixed

- Release workflow: the "sync package version with tag" step failed with
  "npm error Version not changed" when the tag version already matched
  `package.json`. It now bumps only when the versions differ.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- Release workflow now builds Linux (AppImage + deb) in addition to Windows
  (NSIS installer + portable exe) for every `v*` tag.

### Fixed

- Bitwarden sync failed with "Invalid symmetric key length: 111" on accounts
  whose user key is stored as raw bytes (the current Bitwarden client format):
  the account key was decoded as UTF-8 text. Both the raw-bytes and the legacy
  base64-text formats are now accepted, with a clear error for anything else.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-09-01

### Added

- Bitwarden / Vaultwarden sync: mirror SSH keys to the SSH key item type (cipher 5) of the
  user's own vault, configured in Settings (server URL, account email, vault master
  password, folder name defaulting to `SSHSpan`, manual or automatic two-way sync with a
  configurable interval). Newest side wins per item; deletions are never propagated; all
  item fields are encrypted client-side with the Bitwarden protocol; the configured server
  URL is validated against an SSRF guard (http/https only; localhost, `.local`, private,
  link-local, CGNAT and other reserved IPv4/IPv6 addresses rejected, DNS resolution must be
  public); the stored vault password is sealed with the SSHSpan master password; sync
  actions are recorded in the audit log. (Vaultwarden 1.34+ or Bitwarden clients 2024.12+;
  two-factor accounts are not supported yet.)
- Initial public release of the documentation set: README, ARCHITECTURE, SECURITY, PRIVACY,
  CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, LICENSE, CHANGELOG, and .gitignore.
- Vault-protected key store with scrypt key derivation (N=65536, r=8, p=1) and AES-256-GCM
  private key encryption.
- Key management: generate (RSA 3072-8192, Ed25519, ECDSA nistp256/384/521), import, export
  (OpenSSH new-format, PKCS#8, SPKI public, authorized_keys), copy public, update, and delete.
- OpenSSH new-format private key parser supporting none, aes256-ctr, aes256-gcm, and
  chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com ciphers via bcrypt-pbkdf.
- SSH config deployment: marker-bounded managed Host blocks in ~/.ssh/config; deployed key
  files are written to ~/.sshspan/keys/<id> with 0600 permissions on POSIX and
  current-user-only ACLs (icacls /inheritance:r) on Windows.
- Dark-themed vanilla-JS renderer (no framework) with Keys, Deploy, Settings, and Audit
  views, vault gate (create/unlock/change password), keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+1..4, Ctrl+N,
  Ctrl+L, Ctrl+,), and a 10-second auto-lock status poll.
- Audit log recording key, vault, and settings events.
- Settings view with theme, auto-lock timeout, SSH config path, confirm prompts, editor
  font, and fingerprint display options.
- Tray-on-close behaviour on Windows and Linux, single-instance lock, 1100x720 window with
  880x560 minimum.
- NSIS installer shows the MIT license and project URL during setup; GitHub Actions release
  workflow building the Windows installer + portable exe for every `v*` tag with
  changelog-driven release notes.

### Changed

- SQLite persistence via sql.js with atomic tmp+rename saves and a 500 ms debounced flush.

### Fixed

- Bitwarden sync: encrypted vault fields were sent as serialized Promise objects instead of
  ciphertext (un-awaited async encryption), causing HTTP 422 on folder creation and broken
  item push/pull. All encryption call sites are now awaited; the test transport mirrors the
  real async contract.

### Security

- Master password is never stored; only a scrypt verification hash with timing-safe compare.
- Private key material is encrypted at rest; the database file itself is not encrypted.
- Renderer is sandboxed with contextIsolation and a minimal typed preload API.
- No telemetry, no network access, no auto-update.
